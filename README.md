# Focal Length Analyzer

Simple and quick project to get the focal length of images in a directory and it's subdirectories.
Background was to check which focal length I most commonly work with and use this data point in finding a good suited lens for my travels.

## Usage
Change path in `ApplicationRunner` and execute the class.
